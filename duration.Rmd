#median approach plot
spotify_df_median %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = playlist_genre, y = track_popularity, fill = duration_median)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Popularity by Genre and Duration Category (Median)",
    x = "Music Genre",
    y = "Track Popularity",
    fill = "Duration Category"
  ) 
```
We see that for some Genre songs with long duration tend to have lower popularity, for instance, edm and r&b. However, for others there is no such significant differences.
```{r}
#median approach anova test with effect size (Eta-squared)
anova_results_median <- spotify_df_median %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  summarise(
    anova = list(aov(track_popularity ~ duration_median, data = cur_data())),
    eta_squared = map_dbl(anova, ~ eta_squared(.)$Eta2[1])  
  )

anova_summary_median <- anova_results_median %>%
  mutate(
    f_statistic = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`F value`[1]),
    p_value = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1])
  )

anova_summary_median
```
By running anova test and compute effect size using Eta-squared we see that while p-value is significant for all genre except rock with 0.45, the effect size are all small. Hence we can say that Long-duration songs are slightly less popular in some genres (e.g., EDM, R&B, Rap), but the effect is small and not meaningful for practical applications.

```{r}
#standard deviation approach plot
spotify_df_sd %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = playlist_genre, y = track_popularity, fill = duration_sd)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Popularity by Genre and Duration Category (Standard Deviation)",
    x = "Music Genre",
    y = "Track Popularity",
    fill = "Duration Category"
  ) 
```
We see that for some Genre songs with long duration tend to have lower popularity, for instance, edmï¼Œ pop, rap, and r&b. However, for latin and rock there is no such significant differences.

```{r}
#standard deviation approach anova test
anova_results_sd <- spotify_df_sd %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  summarise(
    anova = list(aov(track_popularity ~ duration_sd, data = cur_data())),
    eta_squared = map_dbl(anova, ~ eta_squared(.)$Eta2[1]))

anova_summary_sd <- anova_results_sd %>%
  mutate(
    f_statistic = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`F value`[1]),
    p_value = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1])
  )
anova_summary_sd
```
While all the genre music are statistically significant differences, the effect sizes are very small or even negligible (with Eta-squared < 0.02), indicating that duration explain only a small proportion of the variance in popularity. 

```{r}
#k-means approach plot
spotify_df_kmeans %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = playlist_genre, y = track_popularity, fill = duration_kmeans)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Popularity by Genre and Duration Category (K-Means)",
    x = "Music Genre",
    y = "Track Popularity",
    fill = "Duration Category"
  ) 
```
We see that for some Genre songs with long duration tend to have lower popularity, for instance, edm, latin, pop, and r&b. However, for rap and rock there is no such significant differences.
```{r}
#k-means approach anova test
anova_results_kmeans <- spotify_df_kmeans %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  summarise(
    anova = list(aov(track_popularity ~ duration_kmeans, data = cur_data())),
    eta_squared = map_dbl(anova, ~ eta_squared(.)$Eta2[1]))

anova_summary_kmeans <- anova_results_kmeans %>%
  mutate(
    f_statistic = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`F value`[1]),
    p_value = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1])
  )
anova_summary_kmeans
```
Confirm to previous approaches, even with statistically significance difference the duration have small practical impact on song popularity across genres.

```{r}
#percentile approach plot
spotify_df_perc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = playlist_genre, y = track_popularity, fill = duration_perc)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Popularity by Genre and Duration Category (Percentiles)",
    x = "Music Genre",
    y = "Track Popularity",
    fill = "Duration Category"
  ) 
```
We see that for some Genre songs with long duration tend to have lower popularity, for instance, edm, latin, pop, and r&b. However, for rap and rock there is no such significant differences.

```{r}
#percentile approach anova test
anova_results_perc <- spotify_df_perc %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
   summarise(
    anova = list(aov(track_popularity ~ duration_perc, data = cur_data())),
    eta_squared = map_dbl(anova, ~ eta_squared(.)$Eta2[1]))

anova_summary_perc <- anova_results_perc %>%
  mutate(
    f_statistic = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`F value`[1]),
    p_value = map_dbl(anova, ~ summary(.)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1])
  )
anova_summary_perc
```
Again, while the popularity across duration categories are statistically significant difference, duration explain a small proportion of the variance in popularity.

### Overall
Long duration songs are slightly less likely to be more popular, but the effect of duration is small and varies significantly across genres.
